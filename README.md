# Project Overview

This mini-project involves formulating a hypothesis, establishing the model, and assessing the error.
I use data from historical Olympic games . 
the goal is to predict how many medals a country will earn  based on historical and current data , using a linear regression model.

# Machine learning project steps

in this project , i follow the 7 steps from [Dataquest](https://www.youtube.com/@Dataquestio) provided by VikParuchuri : 
    1.Form a hypothesis.
    2.Find and explore the data.
    3.(If necessary) Reshape the data to predict target.
    4.Clean the data for ML.
    5.Pick an error metric.
    6.Split data.
    7.Train a model.
